This chapter outlines the general features of the \texttt{\getsoftwarename{}} application. We show when the features were introduced and what features and when you can expect to see in the future. This provides a roadmap of where this application has come from and where it is headed. The future features are highly dependent on user feedback. You are highly encouraged to contact us to discuss any new features you would like to see in the application.\\

\softwareSwitch{PBE}{
Note: All but the Damage and Loss (9) features overlap with the requirements for the EE-UQ application.\\
}{}

\Cref{tab:schedule} shows the scheduled release dates for this tool and includes the list of features provided in that release or what you can expect to see in future releases. The individual feature requirements are outlined in \Cref{tab:featureRequirements}. If you would like some additional features added, please contact us.
Additionally, we would appreciate any feedback on this tool. An anonymous
user survey is available \insertsurveylink{here}. \\
